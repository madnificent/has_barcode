HasBarcode
==========

HasBarcode is a plugin that adds barcodes to models.

The barcode specifies the id of the object, so objects can be identified by a barcode-scanner.  It is basically a simple wrapper around the 'barby' plugin for ruby.  The barcodes are stored in 128C barcode encoding ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128 ) which is fairly dense for numbers.


Example
=======

The basic system is very easy to use:

  class Packet < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_barcode
  end

which allows you to say:

  p = Packet.find :first
  p.barcode.to_png  # renders a png barcode
  p.barcode.to_gif  # renders a gif barcode
